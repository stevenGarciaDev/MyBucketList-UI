# MyBucketList Project 

MyBucketList is a social network app that enables people to create a bucket list and connect to other people who have similar tasks on their bucket list. 

The way it works is that users will first create an account.

Then they will add items to their bucket list.

Each item will enable them to view a Group to connect with other people who share that same item on their bucket list.

Other features the app provides enables the ability to add friends, view your friend's bucket list for inspiration, view an activity feed, and send messages to people you are connected with.

## Technology used

The client is built using React and Redux.

The API is built using the Node.js runtime environment and utilizes Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## History of Project 

This project was originally created as an undergraduate 
Senior Project at Cal State Long Beach.

The team consisted of 4 members, including myself (Steven), to create the initial React and Node.js API. 

However as the app grew, the common React problems of prop drilling occurred.

Therefore, I have updated the app to utilize Redux for state management. 

I am currently in progress to update the app to have its state fully utilize the Redux store 
as well as implement unit testing to improve the code coverage for the application.

To view the previous version of the app, before the Redux implementation, you can view
